\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we propose a virtualization technique SVMV
for HaaS or bare-metal cloud computing, where a single 
virutal machine solely runs on a physical server and 
has direct access to all the PCIe devices. In \sna, the VM directly 
interacts with the assigned devices without hypervisor 
intervention. \sna also supports direct delivery all I/O 
and timer interrupts using posted interrupt
delivery mechanism. For load balancing and 
fault-tolerance \sna also demonstrates how 
to migrate a VM with passthrough devices without incurring 
additional downtime. Further, we also maximize the 
resource utilization by guest, by limiting 
the core and memory usage of hypervisor.
