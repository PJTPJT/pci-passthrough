\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a virtualization technique SVMV
for HaaS or bare-metal cloud computing which enables
HaaS operators to manage and migrate customer workloads.
In SVMV, a virutal machine solely runs on a 
physical server and has direct access to all the PCIe devices. 
In \sna, the VM achieves bare-metal performance with 
directly assigned devices without any hypervisor 
intervention. \sna supports direct delivery of all I/O 
and timer interrupts using posted interrupt
delivery mechanism as demonstrated by our implementation.
For load balancing and 
fault-tolerance, \sna demonstrates how 
to migrate a VM with passthrough devices without incurring 
additional downtime. Further, we also maximize the 
resource utilization by guest, by limiting 
the core and memory usage of hypervisor to minimal.
