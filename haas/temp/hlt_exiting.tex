% Implementation details about disabling the VM exits due to
% the HLT instructions.
To disable HLT-related VM exit, the HLT-exiting bit of
processor-based VM-execution control of VMCS is cleared. Our
implementation uses the existing KVM function to set or unset
the HLT-exiting bit. The function is \texttt{vmcs\_write64}.
To update the MSR bitmap, we disable the VM exit due to TMICT
WRMSR. The function is
\texttt{vmx\_disable\_intercept\_msr\_x2apic}. We uses this
function as the prototype and enable the TMICT WRMSR VM exits,
while consulting the MSR bitmap from the Intel Software
Developer Manual.
