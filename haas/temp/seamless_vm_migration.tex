The direct device assignment makes it difficult to migrate the
guest to its destination~\cite{zhai:2008}. After the VM
migration, it is possible that the previously-assigned devices
may not be available at the destination. Even if the assigned
device is available, the internal state of device may not be
readable or still on its way to the destination. The host at
the destination has a hard time to passthrough the device
without the device-specific knowledge. Moreover, some devices
have the unique hardware information that cannot be
transferred, such as the MAC address of network interface
card.
