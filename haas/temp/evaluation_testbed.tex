% Describe the tested including the following items.
% - Hardare configuration: CPU, memory and network cards.
% - Guest: CPU, memory, bonding driver, assigned and virtual devices.
% - QEMU
% - KVM
The experiments are run on machines equipped with the 10-core
Intel Xeon CPU E4 v4 of 2.2GHz, 32GB memory, 40Gbps Mellanox
ConnectX-3 Pro network interface and Intel Corporation
Ethernet Connection I217-LM. The Linux kernel 4.10.1 and QEMU
2.9.0 are installed in the host. The guest is configured with
1 to 9 vCPUs, 10GB of RAM, 1 Virtio and 1 passthrough network
device. The Linux kernel of 4.10.1 and the Ethernet bonding
driver are installed in the guest. The bonding driver operates
in active-backup mode. The TCP/UDP throughput is measured by
the iperf 2.0.5. The CPU utlization is measured by the atopsar
2.3.0. The interrupt latency is measured by the cyclictest
0.93.
