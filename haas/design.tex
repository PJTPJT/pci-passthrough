\section{Design}
% Virtualization support for HaaS include the following items
% - CPU idleness detection and processing
% - Direct NIC assignment
%   - VFIO
%   - CPU optimization for the baremetal network performance
% - Direct interrupt delivery
%   - Posted-interrupt mechanism
%   - Direct timer-interrupt delivery
%     - periodic vs aperiodic timer interrupt
%     - one-shot vs periodic hardware timer interrupt
%     - guest-level access to the PIR page
%     - Eliminate the hardware lock, when the guest accesses
%       the PIR bit
%     - Spurious timer interrupts
% - Seamless baremetal virtual machine migration
%   - NIC bonding with the hot plug/unplug operation migration
%   - DTID during the migration
