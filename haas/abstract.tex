%Motivation
Hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) enables customers to rent physical
machines on cloud platforms to execute their 
applications with near bare-metal performance.
% Problem
However, traditional hypervisor platforms used to host system virtual machines (VMs) 
are heavyweight and impose significant overheads 
in interrupt and I/O processing, making them unsuitable for use in HaaS platforms.
On the other hand, native execution of OS and applications limits 
a cloud provider's ability to migrate customer workloads for system maintenance
and failure recovery.
% Our contributions
In this paper, we propose the \fullname (\acro) to reduce
key virtualization overheads on HaaS platforms.
\name enables a traditional system VM to run atop a thin hypervisor 
and achieve near baremetal performance while retaining the 
administrator's flexibility to live migrate the VM.
A key feature of \name includes
direct delivery of timer and network interrupts to the VM without VM Exits, 
thus eliminating hypervisor-level emulation overheads in interrupt delivery.
% Implementation summary
We describe a prototype implementation on the KVM/QEMU hypervisor
that leverages Intel VT-d hardware support to achieve direct network and timer 
interrupt delivery with no hypervisor intervention, while
supporting live VM migration.
