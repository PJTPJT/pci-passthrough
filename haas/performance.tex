\section{Performance Evaluation}
% Performance evaluation includes the following items.
% - Evaluation testbed and methodology
% - Network bandwidth and latency for the direct NIC assignment
%   - Our CPU optimization
%   - vhost
%   - vfio
%   - NIC bonding of vhost and VFIO
% - DID Efficiency
%   - Delivery effectiveness of NIC interrupts
%   - Delivery effectiveness of local timer interrupts
%   - Time the handling of spurious timer interrupt
% - Service disruption time for the baremetal guest migration
%   - Network downtime
%   - The required time to set up or tear down the VFIO and DTID

\subsection{Evaluation Testbed and Methodology}
\input{temp/evaluation_testbed}

\subsection{CPU and Performance of Assigned Network Device}
% Excel: cpu_network_io_performance.xlsx
% network bandwidth performance: 1 gbps and 40 gbps.
% CPU utilization when guest performs the network I/O.
% number of VM exits during the network I/O.

\subsection{Direct Interrupt Delivery Efficiency}
% Excel: did_efficiency.xlsx
% number of interrupts from the network card.
% number of timer interrupts.
% number of spurious interrupts.
% time to handle the spurious interrupts.
% cyclic test and cumulative probability distribution.

\subsection{Seamless Live Migration}
% Excel: migration_performancy.xlsx
% migration downtime
% network downtime
% time to set up and tear down the VFIO NIC.
% time to set up and tear down the DTID.
