Virtualization Support for HaaS
-------------------------------
- CPU idleness detection and processing
- Direct NIC assignment
  - VFIO
  - NIC bonding of vhost and VFIO
- Direct interrupt delivery
  - Posted-interrupt mechanism
  - Direct timer-interrupt delivery
    - Periodic vs aperiodic timer interrupts
    - One-shot vs periodic hardware timer
    - Guest-level access to the PIR page
    - Eliminate the hardware lock when processing PIR bits
- Seamless physical machine migration
  - NIC bonding with the hot plug/unplug operation during the
    migration
  - DTID during the migration

Performance Evaluation
----------------------
- Evaluation of test bed and methodology
- Energy saving when the CPU is in idle
- Network bandwidth and latency for the direct NIC assignment
  - vhost
  - VFIO
  - NIC bonding of vhost and VFIO
- Efficiency of DTID
  - Delivery effectiveness of NIC interrupts
  - Delivery effectiveness of local timer interrupts
    - Both periodic and aperiodic application-level interrupts
      are present in the test workload
- Service disruption time for physical machine migration
  - Number of missed UDP packets during the migration
  - Number of missed timer interrupt during the migration
