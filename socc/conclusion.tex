\vspace{-0.05in}

In this paper, we presented a single VM virtualization 
mechanism, called \sna, for hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) cloud platforms
that provides both bare-metal server performance for customers
and manageability benefits for cloud operators.
\na enables a HaaS VM to directly interact with I/O devices and 
processor hardware, including direct delivery of device,
timer, and inter-processor interrupts, without hypervisor intervention.
%\sna supports direct delivery of all I/O 
%and timer interrupts using posted interrupt
%delivery mechanism as demonstrated by our implementation.
Our prototype implementation of \na over KVM/QEMU platform 
demonstrated close to bare-metal performance and
interrupt delivery latencies for HaaS VMs along with the
ability to live migrate a HaaS VM without incurring 
additional downtime. 
%Future work includes further reducing virtualization overheads
%for HaaS VMs via direct delivery of IPIs and reduction of
%memory virtualization costs.
