Bare-metal cloud computing, or Hardware as a Service (HaaS), allows customers
to rent remote physical servers so as to install their preferred operating system (OS)
and make the best of the server's raw hardware capabilities. 
Common management functions available on virtualized servers offered 
by cloud platforms, such as live migration and introspection-based 
application performance management, are difficult to 
duplicate on HaaS servers, because HaaS providers typically 
do not install any software on these servers.
To address this manageability gap of existing HaaS platforms, 
we propose a special form of virtualization called the Single Virtual Machine 
Virtualization (SVMV) that is optimized to run a single VM (or HaaS VM)
on a physical server such that the VM's guest OS directly interacts 
with physical I/O devices and timer hardware, as if it runs on
a bare-metal physical server. 
This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of 
a HaaS management system, called 
%\fullname (\sna) 
\sna, to support a HaaS VM 
that can process I/O and timer-related operations 
with close to bare-metal performance.
\na also provides seamless live migration of a HaaS VM
without degrading the migration-induced downtime.

%--------Prof. Chiueh'ss abstract
%Bare metal cloud service is an emerging form of cloud service in which users 
%rent physical servers from a cloud operator because they want to make full 
%use of the server’s underlying hardware without paying any virtualization overhead. 
%Building a bare metal cloud service management system is technically challenging 
%because of the constraint that no software agent could be installed on the 
%physical servers to be rent out. Such a constraint is particularly limiting 
%when it comes to the support for migration of physical machine state and 
%performance monitoring for applications running on physical machines. 
%The ITRI HaaS OS or IHO, is a bare metal cloud service management system 
%that removes this constraint by installing on each physical server a 
%single-VM virtualization hypervisor, which affords the user complete and 
%direct access to all the devices on the server, and at the same time 
%significantly enhances each server’s serviceability and manageability.

%%Motivation
%Hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) enables customers to rent physical
%machines on cloud platforms to execute their 
%applications with near bare-metal performance.
%% Problem
%However, traditional hypervisor platforms used to host system virtual machines (VMs) 
%are heavyweight and impose significant overheads 
%in interrupt and I/O processing, making them unsuitable for use in HaaS platforms.
%On the other hand, native execution of OS and applications limits 
%a cloud provider's ability to migrate customer workloads for system maintenance
%and failure recovery.
%% Our contributions
%In this paper, we propose the \fullname (\sna) to reduce
%key virtualization overheads on HaaS platforms.
%\na enables a traditional system VM to run atop a thin hypervisor 
%and achieve near bare-metal performance while retaining the 
%administrator's flexibility to live migrate the VM.
%A key feature of \na includes
%direct delivery of timer and network interrupts to the VM without VM Exits, 
%thus eliminating hypervisor-level emulation overheads in interrupt delivery.
%% Implementation summary
%We describe a prototype implementation on the KVM/QEMU hypervisor
%that leverages Intel VT-d hardware support to achieve direct network and timer 
%interrupt delivery with no hypervisor intervention, while
%supporting live VM migration.
