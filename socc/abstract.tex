Bare-metal cloud computing, or Hardware as a Service (HaaS), allows customers
to rent remote physical servers so as to install their preferred operating system 
and make the best of server's raw hardware capabilities. 
However, common management functions available on virtualized 
cloud platforms, such as live migration and introspection,
are difficult to duplicate on HaaS servers, because bare-metal
cloud providers typically do not install any software on these servers.
To address this manageability gap of existing HaaS platforms, 
we propose a specialized hypervisor, called the Single Virtual Machine 
hypervisor (\sna) that is optimized to run a single VM, or HaaS VM.
Unlike traditional hypervisors, which limit and control a VM’s access 
to physical resources, the SVMvisor maximizes the HaaS VM’s access to 
physical hardware during normal execution, 
while retaining the ability to live migrate the VM on demand.
This paper describes 
a \na prototype that supports a HaaS VM with dedicated 
CPU and memory resources, direct access to local APIC timer and 
PCIe I/O devices, direct delivery of all interrupts (timer,
inter-VCPU IPIs, and I/O), close to bare-metal performance,
and seamless live migration with low downtime.

%Bare-metal cloud is an emerging cloud service model in which users

%However, building a bare-metal cloud service management system is technically challenging 
%due to the constraint that no software agent can be installed on the

%--------Prof. Chiueh'ss abstract
%Bare metal cloud service is an emerging form of cloud service in which users 
%rent physical servers from a cloud operator because they want to make full 
%use of the server’s underlying hardware without paying any virtualization overhead. 
%Building a bare metal cloud service management system is technically challenging 
%because of the constraint that no software agent could be installed on the 
%physical servers to be rent out. Such a constraint is particularly limiting 
%when it comes to the support for migration of physical machine state and 
%performance monitoring for applications running on physical machines. 
%The ITRI HaaS OS or IHO, is a bare metal cloud service management system 
%that removes this constraint by installing on each physical server a 
%single-VM virtualization hypervisor, which affords the user complete and 
%direct access to all the devices on the server, and at the same time 
%significantly enhances each server’s serviceability and manageability.

%%Motivation
%Hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) enables customers to rent physical
%machines on cloud platforms to execute their 
%applications with near bare-metal performance.
%% Problem
%However, traditional hypervisor platforms used to host system virtual machines (VMs) 
%are heavyweight and impose significant overheads 
%in interrupt and I/O processing, making them unsuitable for use in HaaS platforms.
%On the other hand, native execution of OS and applications limits 
%a cloud provider's ability to migrate customer workloads for system maintenance
%and failure recovery.
%% Our contributions
%In this paper, we propose the \fullname (\sna) to reduce
%key virtualization overheads on HaaS platforms.
%\na enables a traditional system VM to run atop a thin hypervisor 
%and achieve near bare-metal performance while retaining the 
%administrator's flexibility to live migrate the VM.
%A key feature of \na includes
%direct delivery of timer and network interrupts to the VM without VM Exits, 
%thus eliminating hypervisor-level emulation overheads in interrupt delivery.
%% Implementation summary
%We describe a prototype implementation on the KVM/QEMU hypervisor
%that leverages Intel VT-d hardware support to achieve direct network and timer 
%interrupt delivery with no hypervisor intervention, while
%supporting live VM migration.
