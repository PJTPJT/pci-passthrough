%The main technical challenge of providing the guest OS with
%the illusion of running on a bare-metal server is that its
%interactions with I/O devices, such as network interface card
%(NIC) and disk controller, must be direct without going
%through any intermediary. \na allows the sole VM on the
%physical machine to directly interact with PCIe I/O devices,
%timer hardware and the interrupt command register by
%leveraging Intel VT-d~\cite{intelvtd-paper} and Linux Virtual
%Function I/O (VFIO)~\cite{vfio} mechanisms.


%In addition, \na enables direct delivery of device
%interrupts, timer interrupts and inter-VCPU IPIs to a HaaS VM
%without any VM exit by leveraging the posted interrupt
%mechanism in Intel VT-d. 
%Direct interrupt delivery greatly
%reduces the interrupt processing latency and is particularly
%useful for real-time applications running on bare-metal
%servers. 

%When the VM must be live migrated, \na instructs the
%VM to use para-virtual I/O, virtualized timer and indirect
%IPIs and completes the migration. At the destination, it
%switches the VM back to direct I/O device and direct timer
%access and direct inter-VCPU IPIs with minimal disruption of
%VM's workload.
