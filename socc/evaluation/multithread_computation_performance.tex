To evaluate how well a HaaS VM performed for the CPU-bound
applications, we measured the percentage slowdown of CPU,
cache and memory all together by the SPEC CPU
2017~cite{bucek:2018} and PARSEC~\cite{bienia:2008} benchmark.
In our experiment, the HaaS VM had dedicated 8 cores, and 27GB
RAM, whereas \na had the remaining two core, include physical
CPU core 0 and the remaining 5GB RAM. The CPU L1/L2/L3 cache
topology was exposed to the VM. The guest kernel utilized this
information for the scheduling optimization. The bare-metal
was the baseline and had the same configuration as the VM. We
compared the percent slowdown between the Haas and vanilla VM
which did not use our optimizations except the dedicated
cores.
